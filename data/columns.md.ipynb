    "<b>Angina</b>: chest pain due to reduced blood flow to the heart muscles. There're 3 types of angina: stable angina, unstable angina, and variant angina. To know more about angina click here: https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/angina/#:~:text=Angina%20is%20chest%20pain%20caused,of%20these%20more%20serious%20problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>Cholesterol</b>: a waxy substance found in the body cells and it belongs to a group of organic molecules called lipids. There are 3 types of cholesterol; high-density lipoprotein (HDL) and it's known as the \"good cholesterol\", low-density lipoprotein (LDL) known as the \"bad cholesterol\", and very-low-density lipoproteins (VLDL) and as the name implies, they're low dense particles that carry triglycerides in the blood.\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>ECG</b>: short for electrocardiogram, it's a routine test usually done to check the heart's electrical activity.\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>ST depression</b>: a type of ST-segment abnormality. the ST segment is the flat, isoelectric part of the ECG and it represents the interval between ventricular depolarization and repolarization. For more details check this link: https://litfl.com/st-segment-ecg-library/.\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>Thalassemia</b>: it's a genetic blood disorder that is characterized by a lower rate of hemoglobin than normal."
